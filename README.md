# AMD Ryzen Hackintosh ... aka "Ryzentosh"
This is an outline of what went into building my new Hackintosh. I built my first hackintosh way back in 2011 or 2012, and things were much different back then. I had lucked out that one of my laptops I had used for school was an HP ProBook - perfect for making a Hackbook pro. 

So I followed the tutorials online at the time, without really knowing what I was doing, but interested all the same. After days of toiling, I finally got it to work. I was PUMPED! That Hackbook lasted me a long time... and then I finally got a real Macbook Pro, so I didn't really have a need to build another one. Follow that up with work-issued Macbooks and I sort of left hackintoshing in the rearview mirror...

Enter: COVID. I was home and bored and decided that I wanted to build a new computer. So that is what I did. I also decided that I wanted to have dual boot functionality - so I could game, but also to hackintosh again. And that is how I ended up here.

## Working
* **Sleep/Wake**
* **Restart/Shutdown**
  * This was a bit tricky, and caused a lot of issues. At first, restart / shutdown would not work correctly and a power cycle was needed to make the computer functional again. Narrowing this down was a lot of trial and error and Googling.
  * The solution was with USB mapping, specifically, disabling the onboard LED USB controller. I did this with the help of [Hackintool](https://ce05a305-2bad-44e3-9149-3538386d84d9.filesusr.com/archives/191c4b_c0fa53593ddb40c6beae7002a211d8b0.zip?dn=Hackintool.zip). I followed the steps outlined in the OpenCore post-install guide to generate a new USBPort kext, excluding the port that was causing issue. This solved the problem. 
* Ethernet
* Wifi / Bluetooth

## Not Working
* Mic > [[See Details]](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/universal/audio.html#no-mic-on-amd)
  * This isn't really an issue for me as this is a desktop computer and USB mic's work just fine.

## Building Your Own
If you want to build your own Hackintosh, the best place to start is with the [OpenCore Install Guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/). Another great resource, if you are choosing to build an AMD-based computer is the [AMD-OSX forum/discord server](https://forum.amd-osx.com/index.php).  

### This was a frustrating / rewarding / interesting experience, and I am very pleased with the end result. Compared to my 2015 Macbook Pro, this computer performs incredibly well, and the build has been very stable after I ironed out all of the kinks.
